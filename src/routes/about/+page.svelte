              new background. Key features include fast and efficient background
              removal, free and paid pricing plans, competitive pricing compared
              to similar apps, and an easy-to-use interface.

              The accuracy of background removal can vary depending on the tool
              used and the complexity of the image. CaptureQuest is quite
              accurate, even handling tricky elements like hair or transparent
              objects. CaptureQuest is has a free plan so you can give it a try.
